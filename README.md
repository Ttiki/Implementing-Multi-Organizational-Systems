# mplementing Multi-Organizational Systems: Strategies and Ecosystems through Change Theory and Impact-Driven M&E. 
This is my second thesis for the Master SIGLIS diploma from the Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour.

## Abstract
In today’s interconnected world, the implementation of multi-organizational systems has become increasingly vital for collaborative success. This paper delves into the intricacies of establishing such systems, emphasizing the pivotal role of Change Theory and an impact-driven Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) approach. By exploring various strategies and ecosystems, we provide a comprehensive guide on how organizations can synergize their efforts, ensuring effective communication, alignment of objectives, and the realization of shared goals. Through a detailed analysis, we highlight the challenges faced during implementation and propose solutions rooted in Change Theory. Furthermore, we advocate for an M&E approach that prioritizes impact, offering a framework that organizations can adapt to measure success not just in terms of outputs, but in terms of lasting change. This research serves as a beacon for institutions aiming to navigate the complexities of multi-organizational collaborations, ensuring efficiency, adaptability, and meaningful impact.
